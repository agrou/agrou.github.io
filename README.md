Welcome to my github pages.

You can find some of my projects in this repository. 

NutrientCheck is a product under development, that I started for Coursera's Developing Data Products course. You can find all the documentation for using this app on this repository and [here](https://agrou.shinyapps.io/nutrientcheck_app/) you can visualize and use the app.
